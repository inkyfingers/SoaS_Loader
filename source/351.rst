============================================
How did we decide the overlay and home size?
============================================

============================    =======   
livecd-iso, say                  700 MB
overlay-size                     400 MB
home-size                        750 MB
2 GB USB stick capacity, say    1850 MB
============================    =======

When you run livecd-iso-to-disk with impossibly large home and overlay sizes, the script will be interrupted and you will be given the chance to specify sizes which will optimally fit your stick.
