============================================
Edit the command to correct the drive letter
============================================

Don't Press "Enter".

Use the arrow keys to move the cursor over the question mark, use the delete key to remove the question mark.

Replace it with the correct drive letter, in the case of this tutorial it is the letter **"d"**.

In your case it will be the identifier you wrote down. This is the most important part of this exercise, you must direct the commands correctly to *your* target USB stick.
