Prerequisites
=============

To run this Activity successfully you must be running the Fedora Spin named **Sugar on a Stick**. 

Stage 0, Download
-----------------

Involves downloading the *Sugar_on_a_Stick.iso* from Sugar Downloads_.

If you are not yet running Sugar, the linked page contains more information about the SoaS download and getting it.

Stage 1, Make bootable media
----------------------------

The software contained in the download can be transferred to a CD to make a bootable Live CD. This is referred to as burning or writing a CD. This can be done using the default CD writing software of a PC.

There are other options which might suit some users.

You could use a program called UNetbootin_ to write the Sugar image to a USB stick, following these instructions_. This is useful where you do not have a CD writer.

Expert Linux command line uses might use the dd command to transfer the *Sugar_on_a_Stick.iso* to a USB stick.

Both of the above methods produce a non-persistent Sugar on a Stick. A non-persistent Sugar on a Stick, like a Live CD, cannot save work after shutdown and reboot.
 
You could also use another Sugar on a Stick made using the SoaS Loader method.

You will then have booted your PC from one of the above.

Stage 2, the subject of this tutorial
-------------------------------------

SoaS Loader transfers the software producing a USB stick, or flashdrive, with *persistence*, where all work and changes are automatically saved, provided the system is shutdown correctly.

BIOS boot options
-----------------

You will need to ensure the computer you plan to use is capable of booting from a USB stick.

On older machines, you will probably need to make a change in the BIOS_ (see your computer's hardware documentation, it can often be found online). Change the Boot Order, so that "Boot from CD" or "Boot from USB" comes before "Boot from Hard Drive".

Many newer computers detect the USB device as a hard drive.

**Tip** As the computer starts up, look out for a message on the screen inviting you to press a key, say F2, F12, F10, Delete, F11 or Esc. Press the appropriate key to interrupt the regular boot.
