We use just three commands. Let's look at them.

For convenience, the commands are also printed in a compact form on the next page, :doc:`/300a`.

Disk free
---------

::
  
  df -Th

We use disk free to establish the device location.

We run the command once before inserting the target USB stick.

We plug in the USB stick.

We run the command again.

The difference between the two outputs provides an "address" for the target USB stick.

Unmount
-------

To unmount the target USB stick, the command is:

::

  umount /dev/sd?1

Replacing **?** with your drive letter.

That is, replacing ``/dev/sd?1`` with the "address" for your target USB stick.

If editing the command line is new to you there pointers to Help in the section, starting :doc:`/003`.

Using the script
----------------

It is important to get this right as there is a risk of destroying data. If you aim the `livecd-iso-to-disk` command at your hard drive you could destroy your operating system.

Here is a choice of two commands suitable to load Sugar onto either a 2 GB or 4 GB USB stick.

For a 2 GB USB stick
--------------------

::

  su -c "livecd-iso-to-disk --reset-mbr --overlay-size-mb 450 --home-size-mb 750 --unencrypted-home /run/initramfs/livedev /dev/sd?1" 

*replacing* **?** *with your drive letter*

For a 4 GB USB stick
--------------------

::

  su -c "livecd-iso-to-disk --reset-mbr --overlay-size-mb 700 --home-size-mb 2200 --unencrypted-home /run/initramfs/livedev /dev/sd?1"

*replacing* **?** *with your drive letter*
