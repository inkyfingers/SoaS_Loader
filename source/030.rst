Demonstrating copy and paste with date
======================================

Here is a simple command,

::

  date

The computer's output from the command ``date`` is to print out the date.

In Sugar, if we want to copy and paste the above command into the terminal, we can take the following steps. The following slides demonstrate the process. We opened Terminal Activity earlier (:doc:`/020`), it is running in the background.

Use the mouse to select the command.

Copy, use the keyboard shortcut **Ctrl + C** (:doc:`/025`).

Press F6, Frame key to bring in the Frame (:doc:`/008`).

Click on the Terminal Activity icon in the Frame.

Terminal opens.

Open the Edit tab.

Click the Paste button, the command ``date`` appears at the prompt.

Press **Enter** to run the command, and display the output.
