==========================
Establish the drive letter
==========================

Notice the changed output is a new line at the bottom representing the newly inserted device.

The new line reads:

::

/dev/sdd1   vfat  3.7G  4.0K  3.7G   1% /run/media/liveuser/Kingston

``/dev/sdd1`` tells us the device location and in this case the drive letter is **"d"**.

This is important to note. Write down for yourself, **your** drive letter.

Footnote
::::::::

Your identifier should end with the numeral 1, if not, or you get more than one new line of output, the USB stick you have inserted is not sufficiently ”clean”.

Either of the above indicate that the stick is not in a preferred format, for example FAT 32. If this is your first time doing this sort of job, a new USB stick would be ideal.

The script is able to deal with non-standard cases, but the installation probably will not be automatic, requiring some input from the user.
