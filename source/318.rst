==========================
Establish the drive letter
==========================

Notice the changed output is a new line at the bottom representing the newly inserted device.

.. image :: ../images/315.png

The new line reads:

::

 /dev/sdd1   vfat  3.7G  4.0K  3.7G   1% /run/media/liveuser/Kingston

``/dev/sdd1`` is an "address" for my USB stick. In the commands which follow you must use the address you find.

You must alter the commands given, so that the commands are aimed at the address you find.

Put another way,

::

 /dev	indicates 	a location
 /sd 	indicates 	scsi device
 d 	indicates 	the drive letter
 1 	indicates 	partition number

In my case the drive letter is **d**.

Footnote
--------

Your identifier should end with the numeral 1. If not, or you get more than one new line of output, the USB stick you have inserted is not sufficiently ”clean”.

Either of the above indicate that the stick is not in a preferred format, for example vfat. If this is your first time doing this sort of job, a new USB stick would be ideal.

The script is able to deal with non-standard cases, but the installation will probably not be automatic, requiring some input from the user.
