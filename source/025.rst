==================
Keyboard shortcuts
==================

.. Note:: Due to a bug in this development version of SoaS Loader, we apologise
   that the **Copy and Paste buttons** are faulty.
   
   In this version of SoaS Loader, please use keyboard shortcuts rather than
   the Sugar graphical buttons.
   However for our screen shots, the buttons do demonstarate nicely what is going on.

To give the commands to load our stick we enter the commands one by one in the Terminal Activity and press **Enter.**

You can **type** or *Copy and Paste* the command into the terminal.

The longer, third command is much easier to *Copy and Paste* than to type as it is quite long and involved.

**The use of keyboard shortcuts is often most productive.**

**Copy** - the keyboard shortcut is **Ctrl + C** to copy.

**Paste** - the keyboard shortcut is **Ctrl + Shift + V** to  paste into Terminal Activity. 

(Also convenient is to press the centre mouse button to paste into a terminal.)

Edit toolbar buttons
--------------------

Terminal Activity and Sugar Stick Builder both have similar Edit toolbars containing the Copy and Paste functions.
