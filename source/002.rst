Introduction

The first pages of this tutorial are aimed at new Sugar Learners. If you are familiar with Sugar, the work starts at :doc:`/300`.

To make Sugar on a Stick by this method **you must be running a SoaS Live CD or other LiveOS host media.** The page, :doc:`/360`, reviews how to obtain this. This presentation assumes you are running that environment.

You will need a clean USB memory stick, to use as the target device. There is a suitable command for a 2 GB or a 4 GB stick.
